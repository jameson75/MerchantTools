Problem:

You're just starting out or a novice seller and you're trying to find something profitable to sell on eBay.

The typical approach is to attempt to find a product with a high sales volumes and/or sell through rate. At the basic level, many of the eBay Market Research tools employ this strategy to locate the "hottest things to sell". The strategy often relies on weeks, or even months of historical market data (sales and/or watch counts).
 
There-in lies the problem. Tools and strategies rely on high sales or watch-counts for listings to detect potentially profitable products. The problem is that high sales or watch-counts act like a beacon, which attract swarms of sellers and, very often, the power sellers, whom are very difficult to campaign against. By the time enough market data accumulates for a given product, the market has already become over saturated with too many competing listings.

Solution:

What's needed is a search strategy to find the sleepers - the selling opportunities that currently exist under "the swarm's" radar. 

One approach is actual quite simple and straight forward. Identify the brand new listings (just a few days old) which have garnered immediate, consistent sales since inception. Immediate and consistent sales for a new listing is a pretty good indicator that the sell through rate may still be high and the market for this product is still unsaturated. However, with out some tweaks, this strategy can raise a few false flags. One false flag may be an instance where a power seller has entered an already saturated market.
