KYC/AML Regulations:
Bank Secrecy Act
USA PATRIOT Act
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Regulations
FinCEN and FFIEC Guidance
FATF and Wolfsberg Group Guidance

The final big question is how to deal with KYC/AML compliance. 
After all, if the token is to represent actual real estate, the 
investors may have legal rights to dividends and to the real estate itself. 
Therefore, we need to have a way to vet ICO investors. Also, the ability to 
invest and transfer the tokens needs to be limited to identified parties. The 
easiest way to solve the compliance aspects of security tokens is to whitelist 
the identified real estate ICO investors and use exchanges that only allow identified 
investors to trade. If youâ€™re considering a dedicated blockchain, these control 
mechanisms need to be implemented at the protocol level.
